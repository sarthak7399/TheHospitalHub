The Hospital Hub project addresses the need for readily available and centralized information on top healthcare facilities globally. By leveraging web scraping, we strive to compile data on:

Hospital Names and Locations: Identify and locate leading hospitals worldwide.
Doctor Profiles (Future): Extract details on doctors' specialties and qualifications (implementation in future stages).
Treatment Information (Future): Scrape information on the types of treatments offered by each hospital (planned for future development).
Department Details (Future): Gather details on the departments and specializations within each hospital (intended for future inclusion).
This project prioritizes ethical scraping practices, respecting website terms of service and robots.txt guidelines.
